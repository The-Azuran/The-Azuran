I'm Rowan.
I design agroforests. There are several different kinds of agroforests, and I specialize in Silvopastures, which are forest designed for grazing and browsing animals.
My passion is to design ecosystems and I own land, and also advise others on how to steward their land to make it flourish for humans and other organisms.
I want to desentralize the food system. I grew up homeless and in poverty, oftentimes malnutritioned and I wish to end that outcome for all humans.
I recently formalized my consulting business as symbiont systems LLC.
I'm concurrently in graduate school, earning a master's in evironmental science and management from the University of Rhode Island.
I have an undergraduate science degree in Sustainable Agriculture from the same school.
I have also studied philosophy academically very extensively. But I quit and went to trim cannabis for starvation wages and the promise of learning permaculture. It fucking sucked, but I learned a lot.
I'm a veteran of the US Army Infantry.
My unit was A co. 2/7 INF REG "RAGE" 1st Battalion 3ID - a heavily decorated and spearhead forming unit in the army. 
I deployed to Iraq for 15 months from 2007-08 in AL-Ambar Province; first in the towns of Hit, Kubaysa, Ar Rutbah, and also just patroling the lonely desert for months at a time.
I served as a grenadier but rarely used that thing. It was just heavy as fuck. But honestly, I'm happy I had that thing!
Prior to that, I dropped out of a high school that had a 75% drop out rate so I wasn't alone!
